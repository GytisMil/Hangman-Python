# Hangman-Python
A Hangman game made in Python

Necessary files to run the program:
* Hangman.exe
* English_dictionary.txt

These files have to be placed in the same location for **Singleplayer** to be run correctly.

This hangman game features two modes:
* Singleplayer - in this mode the program will select a random word from **English_dictionary.txt** file. You have to guess the word that program picked.
* Dual-Player - this mode is played by two players. The roles are **Hanger** and **Guesser**. Hanger writes a word and Guesser has to figure out the word.

You only have 5 lives, so choose your letters wisely.
